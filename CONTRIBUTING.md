The fun part of this slider - is the underlying domain model which was built with pure functions, inspired by elm, redux and the SAM pattern (of which I'm yet to understand well).

Just make a pull request. Any additional logic should have a test to go with it.

```
npm run # to find out what dev commands you can use
```

Before you push the project - run a build to generate the dist files and test with either a new example - or an updated example.
